Patam 2 Project:
Group members: Kfir Sitalkil, Alon Matias Eliron, Amit Ara, Eden Shviro, Lital Hekmati, Noam Lushi, Hadar Basson.

Summary: A JavaFX flightGear Anomaly detection project in which we build 3 sections: Agent, FrontEnd and BackEnd.
Each section has his own responsibilities and abilities.
The project is very comprehensive: we get a lot of data from our plane for analytics. We also have the ability to control the plane by using the agent's abilities. 
As a whole, our project is a system in which allows you to control, learn and receive data and manage your fleet in the most elegant and proficient way to meet our needs.
